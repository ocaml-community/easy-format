  "High-level and functional interface to the Format module of the OCaml standard library"
description: """

This module offers a high-level and functional interface to the Format module of
the OCaml standard library. It is a pretty-printing facility, i.e. it takes as
input some code represented as a tree and formats this code into the most
visually satisfying result, breaking and indenting lines of code where
appropriate.

Input data must be first modelled and converted into a tree using 3 kinds of
nodes:

* atoms
* lists
* labelled nodes

Atoms represent any text that is guaranteed to be printed as-is. Lists can model
any sequence of items such as arrays of data or lists of definitions that are
labelled with something like "int main", "let x =" or "x:"."""
